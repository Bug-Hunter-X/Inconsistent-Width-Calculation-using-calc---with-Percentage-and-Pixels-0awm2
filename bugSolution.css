To solve the potential issues highlighted in the `bug.css` file, it's crucial to ensure that the parent element's width is explicitly defined or avoid the dependence on percentage-based calculations.  The following demonstrates a solution:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Explicitly define the parent's width */
}

.container {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```

Alternatively, if you want the width to be a combination of relative and absolute units but do not want to depend on the parent element's width, use only fixed values:

```css
.container {
  width: 270px; /* Fixed width for consistent result */
}
```

By explicitly setting the parent's width or using a consistent fixed width, you can avoid any inconsistent behavior in the width calculation of `.container`. Remember to always test across different browsers and scenarios to guarantee consistent results.
