The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue related to unexpected behavior when combining `calc()` and `%` units within the same property:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```

This code intends to set the width of the `.container` element to 50% of its parent's width plus an additional 20 pixels. However, the result might be inconsistent or unexpected across different browsers or contexts, as the calculation might not be handled perfectly.

The unexpected behavior might arise if the parent element doesn't have a definite width defined, as the calculation involves a percentage, making it dependent on the parent's size. This can cause layout instability or unexpected rendering results.
