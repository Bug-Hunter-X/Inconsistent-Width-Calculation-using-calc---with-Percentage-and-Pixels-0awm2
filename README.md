# Inconsistent Width Calculation using calc() with Percentage and Pixels

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue in CSS related to unexpected behavior when combining `calc()` with percentage and pixel units. The issue occurs when attempting to calculate a width using a percentage and a fixed pixel value.

The problem is more prominent when the parent container's width is not explicitly defined, as the percentage calculation depends on the parent's size. This dependency can lead to unexpected results or layout instability.  The issue is highlighted and solved in the provided code samples.
